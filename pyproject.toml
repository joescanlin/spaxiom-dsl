# Spaxiom-DSL

An embedded domain-specific language for spatial sensor fusion, temporal reasoning, and real-time event detection.

## What is Spaxiom?

Spaxiom is a powerful Domain-Specific Language (DSL) designed for building intelligent systems that work with:

- **Spatial Data**: Zones, sensors, and physical spaces
- **Temporal Logic**: Time-based conditions and historical analysis
- **Event Processing**: Triggering actions based on complex conditions
- **Entity Management**: Tracking and querying objects in your system
- **Physical Units**: Working with measurements in a type-safe manner

With Spaxiom, you can easily define complex conditions that span across space and time, and connect them to real-world events.

## Key Features

- 🏠 **Spatial Zones**: Define and work with 2D spatial regions
- ⚡ **Sensors**: Interface with various sensor types and data streams
- ⏱️ **Temporal Logic**: Create conditions that must be true for specific durations
- 🔄 **Event Callbacks**: Register event handlers triggered by complex conditions
- 👥 **Entity Tracking**: Maintain collections of entities with flexible attributes
- 📏 **Physical Units**: Work with measurements and conversions seamlessly
- 🧩 **Logical Operators**: Combine conditions using intuitive &, |, and ~ operators
